                     <h2>Newroz</h2>
                     <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newroz_as_celebrated_by_Kurds" target="_blank"><span class="h-link"> Newroz </span></a>, as one of the most important festivals of the ancient Iranians, is a symbol of rebirth, freshness, freedom, and peace. it is an annual festival and the beginning of the new year. Kurds believe that it dates back to the emergence of the Median Empire around 700 BC. According to Kurdish  myth, Kawa, the blacksmith, killed Zuhak, the tyrant. He lit a bonfire on a mountain, and it was a new day for Kurds and all the other Aryan ethnic groups. After that, Deioces was chosen by seven Kurdish tribes to build the Median Empire, and Deioces succeeded in building the empire. The event is annually celebrated in the time of the spring equinox, and the exact day of Kurdish Newroz is the 21st of March. Newroz is a political and cultural festival, and Kurdish Newroz celebrations are different from those of other nations. However, even the Kurdish communities living in different countries across the Middle East do not celebrate Newroz in the same way and that might be because they do not have a shared state identity. </p>

                     <h2>Folklor</h2>
                     <p>Kurdish folklore, which is almost completely oral, is incredibly rich and diverse. Among the masterpieces of Kurdish oral literature are such traditional stores as Mem and Zin, Khej and Siyabend, Dimdim, and Zembilfirosh. The variety of Kurdish folk song genres is too abundant to go into here, but to give one example; the lawuk is a type of love song which consists of short lyrical verses. An epic romance like Mem û Zîn or Dimdim would traditionally be recited by a dengbêj (pronounced deng-beige) who would accompany himself on a stringed instrument called a tembûr, similar to the Turkish saz or bağlama.</p>

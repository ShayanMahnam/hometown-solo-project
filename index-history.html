                     <p>It is located near the village of Ain Dara, in Afrin, Syria. According to the excavator Ali Abu Assaf, it existed from 1300 BC until 740 BC and remained almost unchanged during the construction of Solomon's Temple (1000â€“900 BC). however, most of it was destroyed by airstrikes following Turkish Air Force in the course of their Afrin offensive. read <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/syria-temple-ain-dara-destroyed-archaeology" target="_blank"><span class="h-link"> more </span></a>about its destruction.</p>

                     <h2>Roman Bridge</h2>
                     <p>Overlooking the Afrin River, within sight of the Turkish border, sprawl the vast Roman ruins of Cyrrhus, a suitable vantage point from which to digest the epic struggles of this region and to ponder the dilemmas unfolding here today. Cyrrhus once served as a military base for the Romans conducting campaigns against the Armenian Empire to the north. By the 4th Century it had become an important centre for Christianity with its own bishop, but was abandoned in the 12th Century after losing its strategic role.

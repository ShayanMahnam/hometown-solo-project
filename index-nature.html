                     <p>Mount Hawar is located 20km north of the city of Afrin, on theright side of the main road leading from Afrin to Raju. the Mountain is covered with dense forest tress, including hawthorn, pistachio, oak, and others. About 75 years ago, these forests were even denser than they are now. the name means 
                         "call for help", and "warning of danger", which of course suits the geographical nature of the mountainand its extreme ruggedness.
